## Installation

Follow the steps below to set up the project locally:

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x (download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
- pip (Python's package installer)
- Git (optional, for cloning the repository)

### Setup Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Ashutoshxo/VIBGYOR-.git
    cd VIBGYOR-
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (recommended for Python projects):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
    If you have a `requirements.txt` file for the project, install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Set up the database** (if applicable):
    - Run migrations to set up the database schema.
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate  # For Django
    ```

5. **Run the application**:
    If using Django:
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
    If using Flask:
